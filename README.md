# Sahibinden-Demo
Frontend &amp; Backend Project


In my project, I effectively utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend to create a user-friendly interface. I organized the structure of pages using HTML and CSS, optimizing style and design elements. Additionally, by employing JavaScript, I introduced dynamic interactions between pages, enhancing the overall user experience.

Simultaneously, on the backend, I developed a robust infrastructure using the PHP language. I performed database operations with PHP, securely managing user data and ensuring the seamless operation of the platform. Throughout this process, I strengthened my knowledge and skills in security measures, contributing to the project's durability and reliability.
